# ExcelJs

The browser version of Excel is written in native JavaScript. The main goal of the project is to implement non-standard
technical tasks without using modern frameworks. According to the idea, this approach allowed me to better understand
what processes are taking place in "under the hood of front-end frameworks" and also teach me to think outside the box.
